# Train-Accidents-Causal-Analysis

In this project, we were tasked to apply evidence-informed systems engineering to address a major safety problem, train accidents.
Earlier with univariate and multivariate data visualization techniques we narrowed our metrics to total casualties( people dead + accidents occured) and Accident damage cost to define the severity of a particular train accident.

So our hypothesis from the earlier project were:
1. Accidents caused by human factors at high train speeds significantly increase total accident damage cost.
2. Derailment accidents that occur at high train speeds significantly increase total accident damage cost.
3. Higher train speeds and accidents caused by human factors cause a significant increase in the number of casualties.
4. Derailment accidents on trains with a high number of cars containing HAZMAT will cause a significant increase in the number of casualties

In this project we try to prove or disprove our above mentioned hypotheses using statistical modeling techniques and evidence-informed systems engineering principles. At the end, we made some recommendations to the FRA which may help in reducing these accidents.
